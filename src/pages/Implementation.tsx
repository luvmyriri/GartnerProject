                Gartner's implementation methodology emphasizes that successful enterprise architecture 
                transformation requires simultaneous advancement across six interconnected domains, with each 
                domain's progress reinforcing and enabling progress in others. For PRC, this means coordinating 
                business process optimization with information architecture improvements, while ensuring 
                application modernization aligns with technology infrastructure upgrades, all within a 
                comprehensive security and governance framework. This holistic approach prevents the common

                  Gartner's Business Architecture implementation for PRC begins with comprehensive capability 
                  mapping across all 46 regulated professions. This process involves conducting stakeholder 
                  workshops with professional boards, examination committees, and regulatory experts to identify 
                  current-state capabilities and define target-state requirements. The methodology emphasizes 
                  understanding not just what processes exist, but how they create value for professionals, 
                  citizens, and the broader healthcare and professional service ecosystem.

                <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                  The implementation progresses through Gartner's Value Stream Analysis, where each professional 
                  lifecycle journey—from examination registration through license renewal—is mapped to identify 
                  optimization opportunities. For PRC, this reveals critical insights about the 47-day result 
                  processing timeline, highlighting specific bottlenecks in examination scoring, validation, 
                  board reviews, and result publication processes that can be streamlined through business
